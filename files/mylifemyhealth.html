          <p>I designed <b><i>My Health, My Life</i></b>, a mobile application designed

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p><b>My Role</b>: Undergraduate Researcher<br>
          <b>Date</b>: Sept 2014 - Aug 2015<br>
          <b>Awards</b>: 2014 - 2015 UC Irvine Women's Empowerment Initiative UROP Fellow,
          Summer 2015 UC Irvine SURF-IoT Fellow<br>
          <b>Tools</b>: Balsamiq Mockups, Photoshop CS6</p>

          <h3>Breast Cancer Statistics</h3>
          <p>According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, breast cancer
          is the most common cause of death from cancer among Hispanic women. Studies
          have reported that less than half of breast cancer survivors engage in the
          recommended level of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity
          physical activity. Support and clinic-based educational programs have been demonstrated
          in clinical studies as effective in changing behaviors and improving outcomes in cancer
          patients and survivors. However, these programs are rarely tailored down to the individual
          level.</p>

          <h3>Study Aims</h3>
          <img src="img/breastcancersymbol.png" alt="Breast Cancer Symbol">
          <p>The focus of this study was to discover how to improve the lifestyle of Latina breast cancer
          survivors by determining how to best integrate self-management strategies throughout breast
          cancer survivorship with the use of a smartphone-based system, Mi Salud, Mi Vida. The two
          study aims were as follows: To discover the personalization needs of Latina breast cancer
          survivors in order to inform the development of features to address their thoughts, beliefs,
          opinions, and experiences as survivors and to design and develop the user interface that will
          best attend to the technological and personalization needs of Latina breast cancer survivors
          through focus groups and survey methods.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Discovery of the Problem</h3>
          <p><b>Background Research</b>: I conducted extensive background research and literature review to gain insight into
          technological solutions for cancer survivors and determined health factors essential to track for
          promoting weight loss.<br>
          <b>Focus groups and surveys</b>: Semi-moderated focus groups were conducted at the UC Irvine Family Health
          Center with Latina breast cancer survivors and some of their family members. There were approximately
          48 survivors ages 33-85 years old and the number of years since their diagnosis ranged from 1-13 years.
          Focus group surveys inlcuded sections regarding breast cancer care and experience, health behaviors and
          other activities, use of technology, and demographic information. Interviews were transcribed and and
          survey data was analyzed in SPSS for behavioral patterns along with needs, personnel, and values. Some
          measures included demographics, type of smartphone, usage patterns, health-related information searching,
          and communication with medical staff through technological platforms.<br>
          <b>Competitive Analysis</b>: I conducted a competitive analysis and evaluated m-Health applications in the
          market. I explored main features and sub-feature availability, customer reviews, and overall ratings across
          20 m-Health apps and documented these findings in an Excel spreadsheet and detailed report. This analysis
          was useful for idea generation, gathering design requirements, and defining goals for the initial release.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Ideating</h3>
          <p><b>Brainstorming</b>: Using my research findings, data analysis, and competitive analysis as guides, I brainstormed design solutions
          and through periodic detailed discussions with my three mentors. These wireframes provided us with a way to visualize
          how information could best be presented on a mobile device and design the best possible user experience.<br><br>

          <h3>Building</h3>
          <p>I collaborated with our app developer and communicated task flows to generate the user interface and interactions.
            (Limitations: Due to timing and funding constraints, we were unable to conduct thorough user testing).</p>
