        <h3>MY STORY</h3>
        <p><em>Hi, my name is Nicole and this is my story about how I became
        passionate about user experience design.</em></p>
        <p>From 2011-2015, I studied <a href="http://publichealth.uci.edu/ph/_home/">Public Health Sciences</a>
        and minored in Health Informatics (HI) at <a href="https://uci.edu/">UC Irvine</a>. I became really
        interested in the field of HI when I took my first Intro course at UCI. One of the topics we discussed
        was the issues that hospitals faced with EHR systems and the one issue that stuck out to me was how
        errors in these systems caused the deaths of patients. As an avid tech enthusiast, I was upset, frustrated,
        and quickly became curious and driven to explore technologyâ€™s role in healthcare. This was the
        moment it clicked in my head that what I wanted to do with the rest of my life was to discover how technology
        can improve and innovate healthcare and the life sciences.</p>
        <p>In 2015, I continued my studies as a masters student of <a href="http://healthinformatics.umich.edu/">Health
        Informatics</a> at <a href="http://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> and was exposed to a multitude of
        contexts in which technology, design, and healthcare intersect. I learned
        that, compared to other industries, <b>healthcare is extremely complex</b> and to
        design successful technological solutions in this industry that really work
        is challenging. I learned that core to doing so is not only understanding
        people, their attitudes, and their behaviors, but also the context in which people
        work - <i>because in healthcare, there is rarely a one-size-fits-all solution.</i><br></p>

      <section>
        <h3>MY GOAL</h3>
        <p>I believe that my purpose is to help advance healthcare through technology.
        I am dedicated to designing beautiful data-driven experiences in the healthcare
        space as I pursue my early passion as a UX researcher and designer.</p>
